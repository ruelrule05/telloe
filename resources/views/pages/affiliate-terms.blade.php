                        fail, the Parties shall then submit the dispute to binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in the following county: Australia. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, and such arbitrator
                        shall have no authority to add Parties, vary the provisions of this Agreement, award punitive damages, or certify a class. The arbitrator shall be bound by applicable and governing Federal law as well as the law of Queensland.
                        Each Party shall pay their own costs and fees. Claims necessitating arbitration under this section include, but are not limited to: contract claims, tort claims, claims based on Federal and state law, and claims based on
                        local laws, ordinances, statutes or regulations. Intellectual property claims by the Company will not be subject to arbitration and may, as an exception to this sub-part, be litigated. The Parties, in agreement with this
                        sub-part of this Agreement, waive any rights they may have to a jury trial in regard to arbitral claims.
